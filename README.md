# ðŸ¥´ ujyhmn-n

A portable Ujyhmn n implementation made in Lua. I whipped this up in around 2 hours and the whole thing is ~130 KB. As the lua.exe is already provided, you **do not need any prequisites to run it!** Right now, it only works for Windows, and it will likely stay that way.

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

Download the repository and extract it to any where on your computer. To run a Uyjhmn n script, it must be in your directory. Simply run "run.bat <script>.uyj", where script is the name of your Ujyhmn n script.

There is also a method where you can run a Uyjhmn n script from anywhere on your computer. 

When Uyjhmn n is downloaded to your computer, copy the path by double-clicking the area left of the Search button and pressing Ctrl+C.

Press the Windows key on your computer and begin typing "Environment Variables"(or just search it from your search bar). When it shows "Edit the system environment variables", press Enter or click it. It should open up a window with the title "System Properties" and the "Advanced" tab selected. Now, click on the "Environment Variables" button in the bottom right. On the "User Variables for User" section, scroll down to find "path", it should be under the Variables column.

Double click path, and press the "New" button. Paste in your folder path for Uyjhmn n. Press "Okay" on all the windows you've opened.

Congrats, you've added Uyjhmn to your PATH, which means you can now use it like this:

uyjhmn example.uyj

And from anywhere on your computer!

If the command is not working, try restarting your terminal.
